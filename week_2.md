# Week 2: Tarot Cards in React

### JSPM vs. create-react-app

There are a lot of ways to "bootstrap" a React app. The old way was to install Babel (for transpiling to ES6), webpack (for building things into modules -- link to that one grunt guide here, and related modules separately, configure everything, and try not to pull your hair out. 

In addition to all the difficult ways, as of September 2016 there are at least two incredibly *easy* ways: JSPM, a much simpler bundling tool than webpack that seems to be some sort of combination of Bower and Browserify, and the create-react-app application provided by Facebook. I'll explain how to set up both of them and their pros and cons.
