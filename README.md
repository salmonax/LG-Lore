# Learners Guild Weekly Guide

This is the stuff I covered every week, written as a guidebook for future learners.

Not sure what format this stuff will end up in, but this will work for now.

## Notes on the Approach

I'm writing this completely discursively, in a lesson format rather than as a journal. My hope is that it will help somebody that might have too much difficulty implementing certain functions on their own get enough context to get 80% of the way there, but still have to do some thinking on their own. In other words, if a direct example is provided for how I ended up writing the matches() function in Lodash using partial-application, I might do so without any error or type checking, and the tests will not be included, and some emphasis will be placed on blah blah GO TO SLEEP.

Not all projects lead to clean lessons, but they will have allowed for a contrast of perspectives, such as the React project in Week 2.
